## Project Proposal

#### Brief Description of the Final Database : 
##### Fast Food nutrition. Accumulate fast food sandwich nutritional facts.

### Sandwich Fast Food Restaurants:
* Jimmy Johns - 32 sandwiches
* Panera - 22 sandwiches
* Subway - 38 sandwiches
* Quiznos - 24 sandwiches
* Blimpie - 35 sandwiches

#### Why is our final database useful to a hypothetical organization?
* To create a repository for people interested in nutrition and making positive food choices
* For a potential sandwich shop to get competitor data to create a better shop.

#### A list of data sources :
*  [Food Nutrition.org](https://fastfoodnutrition.org/)
*  [Subway](https://www.subway.com/en-US/MenuNutrition/Nutrition/NutritionGrid)
*  [Blimpie](https://www.blimpie.com/assets/BlimpieNutritionalInfo.pdf)
*  [Jimmy Johns](https://resources.jimmyjohns.com/downloadable-files/NutritionGuide.pdf)
*  [Panera](https://www-beta.panerabread.com/content/dam/panerabread/integrated-web-content/documents/Panera-Nutrition.pdf)
*  [Quiznos](https://www.quiznos.com/assets/images/NutritionalInfo.pdf)

#### Brief summary of the 3 ETL steps we will take to create this database:

We will be using Postgres since our collective data is all similar and we are not having different kinds of data.  Also, since we have specific information, we can also make sure to secure its type. 

#### ETL STEPS
1. Scrape the data for sandwiches for the chosen joints from https://fastfoodnutrition.org/
2. Collect all the required data
3. Create a Quick DBD flow chart
4. Merge all the collected data into postgres sql database
5. Create a comprehensive ReadMe File
6. Create sample queries
